**OICFM-PNP: A LAN-Based System Utilizing Data Analytics and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Technology**  

Effective firearm monitoring is crucial for law enforcement. This project, **OICFM-PNP**, introduces an innovative LAN-based system that integrates Data Analytics and OCR technology to optimize firearm inventory management in the Northern Police District (NPD).  

While the centralized **PNP Logistics Data Information and Management System (LDIMS)** efficiently oversees assets, it lacks a tailored solution for NPD's specific needs. **OICFM-PNP** complements LDIMS by providing localized monitoring, improving data accuracy, and ensuring operational efficiency.  

**Capstone Objectives:**  
- **Efficiency:** Streamline firearm inventory management processes using OCR technology.  
- **Accuracy:** Ensure precise identification and updating of firearm serial numbers.  
- **Insights:** Leverage data analytics for enhanced decision-making and security monitoring.  

**Key Questions:**  
1. How effective is the LAN-based system in managing firearms and generating reports for NPD?  
2. How accurate and efficient is the OCR system in identifying firearm serial numbers?  
3. How well does data analytics support firearm monitoring and decision-making?  

**OICFM-PNP** bridges gaps in inventory control, enhances public safety, and serves as a model for other agencies. By addressing current system limitations, NPD can achieve precise, secure, and efficient firearm management.
